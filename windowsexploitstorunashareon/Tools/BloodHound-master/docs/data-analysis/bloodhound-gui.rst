The BloodHound GUI
==================

The BloodHound GUI is where the vast majority of your data
analysis will happen. Our primary objectives in designing the
BloodHound GUI are intuitive design and operational focus. In
other words, we want you to get access to the data you need
as easily and quickly as possible.

Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you open the BloodHound GUI for the first time, you will
see an authentication prompt:

.. image:: /images/bloodhound-logon.png   
   :align: center
   :width: 900px
   :alt: BloodHound logon screen

.. note:: Want to follow along? Connect to the example hosted database:
* DBurl: `bolt://206.189.85.93:7687` 
* DBusername: `neo4j` 
* DBpassword: `BloodHound`
  

The "Database URL" is the IP address and port where your neo4j
database is running, and should be formatted as bolt://ip:7687/

The DB Username is the username for the neo4j database.
The default username for a neo4j database is neo4j.

The DB Password is the password for the neo4j database. The
default password for a neo4j database is neo4j. The password
for the example database is BloodHound.

Click "Login", and the GUI will attempt to authenticate to neo4j
with the information you provided.

You can optionally click "Save Password" to automatically log in
next time with the same info.

After successful authentication, the BloodHound GUI will do three
things:

1. First, the GUI will perform a cypher query to ensure the graph
   schema has the appropriate indices and constraints. These operations
   prevent duplicate node creation and greatly speed up node lookup
2. Second, the GUI will collect stats about the database and display
   those stats in the "Database Info" tab.
3. Finally, the GUI will query for all users that belong to any Domain
   Admins group, then display those users and show how they belong to
   the Domain Admins group.
   
Upon successful logon, BloodHound will draw any group(s) with the
"Domain Admins" in their name, and show you the effective users that
belong to the group(s):

GUI Elements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Graph Drawing Area
------------------

As much of the screen real estate as possible is dedicated to the graph
rendering area - where BloodHound displays nodes and the relationships
between them. You can move nodes around, highlight paths by mousing over
a node involved in a path, and click on nodes to see more information
about those nodes. You can also right click nodes and perform several
actions against those nodes:

.. image:: /images/right-click-group-node.png   
   :align: center
   :width: 900px
   :alt: Right click menu on a group node

* **Set as Starting Node:** Set this node as the starting point in the
  pathfinding tool. Click this and you will see this node's name in the
  search bar, then you can select another node to target after clicking
  the pathfinding button.
* **Set as Ending Node:** Set this node as the target node in the pathfinding
  tool.
* **Shortest Paths to Here:** This will perform a query to find all shortest
  paths from any arbitrary node in the database to this node. This may cause
  a very long query time in neo4j and an even longer render time in the
  BloodHound GUI.
* **Shortest Paths to Here from Owned:** Find attack paths to this node from
  any node you have marked as owned.
* **Edit Node:** This brings up the node editing modal, where you can edit
  current properties on the node or even add your own custom properties to
  the node.
* **Mark Group as Owned:** This will internally set the node as owned in the
  neo4j database, which you can then use in conjunction with other queries
  such as "Shortest paths to here from Owned"
* **Mark/Unmark Group as High Value:** Some nodes are marked as "high value"
  by default, such as the domain admins group and enterprise admin group.
  This can then be used with other queries such as "shortest paths to high
  value assets"
* **Delete Node:** Deletes the node from the neo4j database

You can also right click edges, then click "help" to see information about
any particular attack primitive:

   :align: center
   :width: 900px
   :alt: Right click edge and get help
   
Finally, there are two keyboard shortcuts when the graph rendering area has
focus:

* **CTRL**: Pressing CTRL will cycle through the three different node label
  display settings - default, always show, always hide.
* **Spacebar**: Pressing spacebar will bring up the spotlight window, which
  lists all nodes that are currently drawn. Click an item in the list and the
  GUI will zoom into and briefly highlight that node.

Search Bar
----------

In the top left of the GUI is the search bar. Start typing the name of a node,
and the GUI will automatically recommend nodes that match what you've typed so far.
Click one of the suggestions, and the GUI will render that node:

.. image:: /images/node-search.gif  
   :align: center
   :width: 900px
   :alt: Search for nodes using the search bar
   
You can also constrain your search to particular node types by prepending your
search with the appropriate node label. For example, you can search for just
groups with the word "Admin" in them with this search:

::

   group:Admin
  
You can prepend your search with the following node types:

* Group
* Domain
* Computer
* User
* OU
* GPO

Pathfinding
-----------

One of the most powerful features of BloodHound is its ability to find attack
paths between two given nodes, if an attack path exists. Within the search bar
is the "pathfinding" button, which brings down a second text box where you can
type in the name of a node you want to target.

For example, if we wanted to find a path from the "Domain Users" group to the
"Domain Admins" group, we can use the path finding feature like this:

.. image:: /images/pathfinding.gif  
   :align: center
   :width: 900px
   :alt: Search for an attack path
   
Depending on your opsec requirements or other factors, you may want to find
attack paths that do not include particular attack primitives, such as AD object
manipulation. Click the filter icon to bring up the edge filtering pane, and select
or de-select the particular edges or class of edges as needed:

   :align: center
   :width: 900px
   :alt: Edge filtering pane

Raw Query Bar
-------------

With query debug mode enabled, any time the BloodHound GUI performs a cypher query
where the results are shown in the graph rendering area, the cypher query itself
will appear here. This can be helpful for learning cypher:

.. image:: /images/raw-query.gif  
   :align: center
   :width: 900px
   :alt: Raw query bar

Additionally, you can execute your own cypher queries using the raw query bar.
Your cypher query must return either paths or nodes, the BloodHound GUI cannot
render list output. For example, to return all "user" type nodes in the database:

.. image:: /images/run-raw-query.gif  
   :align: center
   :width: 900px
   :alt: Run a raw cypher query

Upper Right Menu
----------------

In the upper right are several menu items for you to interact with. From the top
going down:

* **Refresh**: Re-run the last query and display the results
* **Export Graph**: Export the currently rendered graph in JSON format
* **Import Graph**: Select a JSON formatted graph for the GUI to render
* **Upload Data**: Select your SharpHound data to upload to neo4j
* **Change Layout Type**: Switch between hierarchial or force directed layout
* **Settings**: Configure node and edge display settings, as well as query debug mode,
  low detail mode, and dark mode here.
* **About**: Displays author and version information
